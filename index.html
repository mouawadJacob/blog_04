            <time>January 5th, 2023</time>
            <p>Virtual reality is the immersion of the brain in a virtual world. By using headsets, controllers, 
                and a plethora of other more optional hardware pieces it allows the user to experience and usually 
                interact with a completely different environment made in a virtual setting. Virtual reality or VR 
                for short has been progressing at an astonishing rate in recent years. While it used to be primarily 
                an outlet for entertainment through video games and videos; it has now branched out into fields like 
                medicine and the automotive industry to help with the preparation of surgery and even the development 
                of new cars and we can expect even more developments and new uses for VR in the different work fields. 
                Now for some interesting statistics in relation to VR:<br/>
                - “VR can reduce the risk of injury in the workplace by 43%”
                - “VR in e-commerce can boost online shopping conversion by 17%”
                - “1 in 3 users have experienced motion sickness of cybersickness during their VR experience”
