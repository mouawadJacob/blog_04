            <p>Virtual reality is the immersion of the brain in a virtual world. By using headsets, controllers, 
                and a plethora of other more optional hardware pieces it allows the user to experience and usually 
                interact with a completely different environment made in a virtual setting. Virtual reality or VR 
                for short has been progressing at an astonishing rate in recent years. While it used to be primarily 
                an outlet for entertainment through video games and videos; it has now branched out into fields like 
                medicine and the automotive industry to help with the preparation of surgery and even the development 
                of new cars and we can expect even more developments and new uses for VR in the different work fields. 
                Now for some interesting statistics in relation to VR:<br/>
                - “VR can reduce the risk of injury in the workplace by 43%”
                - “VR in e-commerce can boost online shopping conversion by 17%”
                - “1 in 3 users have experienced motion sickness of cybersickness during their VR experience”

            <p>Augmented reality or AR for short has been around along time. For example the Nintendo Dsi had games based around augmented reality,
                and that led to the birth of bigger more recent AR games like Pokemon go, or the new Monster Hunter now. But what is AR and what
                uses does it have outside of gaming, or entertainment. AR is a concept linked but almost opposite to VR. Instead of putting the mind 
                into a virtual environment AR takes a virtual object and places it in the real world. Now with all the rapid advances in the tech field
                AR has become an important part of our world with uses outside of the entertainment world, and into the fields of education, retail, 
                and even medicine, just to list a few. As for how it impacts them it can allow students to have manipulatable 3d models. Buyers can see 
                what products look like on them or in their home before purchasing products. And Surgeons use AR to give themselves a headsup display of 
                any vital information they may need throughout their procedure. There is much more to know about AR and where it's headed so if anything 
                you just read interests you I sugest you click the link above and check out the indepth article.

            <p>Generative AI or gen AI for short is a form of AI that gives responses to inputs with text, images, or other outlets using the input training
                it has been put through to give those answers based on the patterns it can find between the input and its data base. In the last year
                the useage of gen AI has grown by an astronomical amount. being used in almost every industry by at least one of the business departments
                it is no longer just a program used in the tech industry. however, it is not yet right to fully trust the answers given out by these programs, 
                and many of these companies need to make better efforts to prepare for the potential risks these programs can cause. for example, misinformation
                given from not proofing the answers given by the AI before moving ahead with using their inputs and outputs. as well as other risks like cybersecurity,
                or copyright infingments. for more info on this topic click on the link to the full article above.

            <p>The metaverse is a computer simulation closely linked to the real world that gives a high level of realism through the usage of virtual and augmented 
                reality outlets. This digital environment has limitless potential where you the user can create or explore all the different spaces and 
                partake in digital transactions. The world has already been moving in this direction for quite some time and especially now as many things 
                have been moved to online and into a virtual environment. It is only getting further supported through new technologies creating more 
                connections within the extended reality (XR) marketplace. This marketplace specifically is a major factor in the growth of the metaverse.
